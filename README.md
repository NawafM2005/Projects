Hello,

My name is Nawaf, and I am pleased to share with you a repository containing a selection of my previous projects, both those I have individually developed and those in which I have actively participated.

As of right now, I am in my second year as a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Should you wish to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me at Nawaf.mahmood2005@gmail.com.

Thank you for your time

Sincerely,

Nawaf
